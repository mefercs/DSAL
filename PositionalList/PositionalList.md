We use them because there is not always an efficient manner to use an index
to refer for some item in a DataStructure ADT. This allow us to know the 
position of some item if we want to do something in the DataStructure.
In general we wish to be able to locate a position of an element in a 
sequence without the use of a integer index.

- Each position item in the Positional lists acts as a marker o token in the broader Posional List.
