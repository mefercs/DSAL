They are a way to represent relathionships that exist between a pair of objects. That is, It's a 
set of objects called vertices.
Viewed abstractly, a graph G is simply a set V of vertices(sometimes called nodes) and a collection E
of pairs of vertices from V , called edges(sometimes called arcs).

- The edges can be directed or undirected, and edge (u,v), is said to be directed from u to v. u->v, 
  and is not directed(undirected) if u and v are not ordered, which sometimes is represented with
  {u,v} instead of (u,v).
  - an example of a directed graph is inheritance of OOP, because the father class
    is connected with the child class in that order. As this is in one direction, the relation
    is asymmetric.
- Examples:
  - The streets of a city : Mixed graph
  - Electric circuits 

Between an edges, if the graph is directed, then we have an origin and a destination of an 
edge.

- Two vertices are adjacend if there is an arc/edge which have those vertices as endpoints.
